# commerce - An interactive eBay-like auction site built with Django

This is my submssion for Project 2 of CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript.


# To run:
1. Make sure you have [python3 and django installed](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/install/) in your current environment
2. cd into the `commerce` directory
3. Run `python3 manage.py makemigrations` to make any necessary migrations.
    If this creates any migrations, now run `python3 manage.py migrate` to apply them to the database.
5. Create a superuser account by running `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`, and filling out the requested fields
6. Run `python3 manage.py runserver`
7. Access the web app locally at  http://127.0.0.1:8000
8. You can also access the site admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ with your superuser account
